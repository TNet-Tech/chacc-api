# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Version endpoint** – `GET /api/version` now exposes the installed package version, name, and Python version. The welcome page and status badge fetch this dynamically instead of hardcoding the version string, so the UI always reflects the running build.
- **Docker entrypoint script** – `deployment/docker/docker-entrypoint.sh` auto-creates and chowns all data directories (`/app/.modules_installed`, `/app/.modules_loaded`, `/app/.modules_upload`, `/app/.chacc_cache`, `/app/backups`, `/app/plugins`) at container start, then drops privileges to the `chacc` user via `gosu`. Any new volume mounted under `/app` is automatically handled — no script edits or rebuilds needed.

### Fixed

- **Dependency resolution health check integration removed** – The status file mechanism (`src/module_loader/resolve_deps.py`) that communicated resolution progress to the `/api/health` endpoint has been removed. By the time resolution runs, the server is not yet accepting requests, so the health check integration served no purpose. The `/api/health` endpoint no longer tracks dependency resolution state. The frontend polling animation (`index.js`), banner element (`index.html`), and spinner styles (`index.css`) have also been removed.
- **psycopg3 binary backend** – PostgreSQL connections now use `psycopg[binary]`, which bundles the required `libpq` library inside the Python package. This removes the need for system-level `libpq` installation or compilation, so the server starts cleanly on minimal images like `python:3.12-slim` and in fresh virtual environments without a PostgreSQL client installed.
- **Docker permission denied** – `DependencyManager()` calls in `src/chacc_dependency_manager.py` now pass `DEPENDENCY_CACHE_DIR` instead of falling back to the default `.dependency_cache`, which was never created in the image.
- **Docker build failure** – `.dockerignore` now re-includes `deployment/docker/docker-entrypoint.sh` after the `deployment/` exclusion, so the entrypoint script is available in the build context.
- **Piptools home directory error** – the `chacc` user is now created with `-d /app`, and the entrypoint chowns `/home/chacc` as a safety net. Previously, `pip-tools` resolved `~` from `/etc/passwd` to `/home/chacc` and failed with `Permission denied`.
- **New modules loaded without dependency resolution** – `load_modules()` in `src/module_loader/loader.py` now processes archives and commits DB records **before** resolving dependencies, then re-queries the database for the enabled set. Previously, dependency resolution ran before `process_module_archives()` created DB records for newly-discovered modules, so a module deployed via `POST /api/modules/` would start without its dependencies installed. Resolution is now gated behind `ENABLE_PLUGIN_DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION` for both production and dev paths, and the misleading production-stability warning in `src/env_validator.py` has been removed.
- **Module dependencies not installed in Docker** – dependency resolution now runs as root in the Docker entrypoint (`deployment/docker/docker-entrypoint.sh`) via a new standalone script (`src/module_loader/resolve_deps.py`) before the entrypoint drops to the `chacc` user. Previously, `pip install` ran inside the app process as the `chacc` user, which lacks write access to `site-packages`, so module dependencies were never installed and modules failed to load with `ImportError`. The cache-hit path in the chacc dependency manager now correctly detects missing packages and installs them.

## 1.0.0-beta5.1


**Update now:**
> PyPi Package:
```bash
pip install --upgrade chacc-api==1.0.0-b5.post1
```

> Docker
```bash
docker pull jonas1015/chacc-api:1.0.0-beta5.1
```

### Fixed

- **psycopg3 migration** – ChaCC now uses the modern `psycopg` (psycopg 3) driver for both synchronous and asynchronous PostgreSQL connections. The CLI and server no longer require the legacy `psycopg2` package, so database connections work cleanly on Python 3.12 and newer.
- **CLI no longer loads the database** – The `chacc` command-line tool is now fully independent from the server package. Running `chacc --help`, `chacc create`, `chacc build`, or `chacc install` no longer initializes a database engine or requires database drivers, making the CLI faster and safer to use anywhere.
- **Lazy package loading** – Importing `chacc_api` is now lightweight. Database-backed components like `ChaCCBaseModel`, `ModuleRecord`, and the database engine are only loaded when you actually use them, so lightweight tools and scripts can import the package without side effects.
- **Colored CLI output** – Install progress, warnings, and results now use text colors (green for success, red for failure, yellow for warnings) to make terminal output easier to read. Colors automatically turn off in CI logs and pipes.

## 1.0.0-b5


**Update now:**
> PyPi Package:
```bash
pip install --upgrade chacc-api
```

> Docker
```bash
docker pull jonas1015/chacc-api:1.0.0-b5
```

### Added

- **`chacc install` command** – Install any ChaCC module from a Git repository or local folder in one step. You can use a full URL, an SSH address, or the short form like `TNet-Tech/chacc_outbound`. Use `--dev` to copy the module into the plugins directory for active development, or leave it off to build a production `.chacc` archive automatically. Supports `--ref` for branches, tags, and commits, `--force` to overwrite existing modules, and private repositories via `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, or `CHACC_GIT_TOKEN`. Includes a friendly step-by-step progress display with colored status markers so you always know what is happening. See the [CLI install guide](cli.md#install-a-module) for the full reference.


- **Async database support for modules** – Modules can now connect to the database without blocking the server. When you create a new module with `chacc create`, the generated code includes everything needed to run database queries asynchronously.
- **Chacc Outbound module** – A new official module for sending emails, SMS, and other messages. It includes automatic retries, delivery status tracking, and a pluggable adapter system (SMTP and console adapters included out of the box). See the [Chacc Outbound docs](official-modules/outbound.md) for setup, REST API, and how to write custom adapters.

### Fixed

- **Database connections leaking in generated code** – The scaffolded `get_db` dependency now properly closes the database session after each request, preventing connection leaks over time.
- **Docker startup issues** – Fixed a problem where the database failed to migrate during startup in production mode.
- **Docker permission errors** – Fixed a permission issue that prevented the dependency resolver from writing its cache.
- **PostgreSQL enum migration crashes** – Fixed a crash when changing a column from one enum type to another. ChaCC now handles the conversion smoothly through an intermediate step, so enum migrations work without manual SQL.
- **Module loading crashes** – Fixed a crash that occurred when some plugins loaded their models in certain orders. The startup process is now more forgiving and handles edge cases gracefully.
- **Migration crashes** – Improved how ChaCC reads migration plans from Alembic, eliminating rare crashes during database updates.
- **Code cleanup** – Removed unreachable error handling code and eliminated an unnecessary global directory change during archive building, making the install flow easier to follow and safer in multi-threaded environments.

### Changed

- **Module name validation enforced in build path** – `chacc build` and the internal build step of `chacc install` now both normalize module names the same way. This ensures that module names behave consistently whether you are building a package or installing one.

## 1.0.0-b4.5


**Update now:**
> PyPi Package:
```bash
pip install chacc-api==1.0.0-b4.post3
```

> Docker
```bash
docker pull jonas1015/chacc-api:1.0.0-b4.5
```

### Changed

- **Module naming convention** – Module directories now use underscores instead of hyphens (for example, `chacc_file_manager` instead of `chacc-file-manager`) to match Python naming standards. This makes the import system work consistently across the module loading pipeline. If you have existing modules, rename your module directories and update the `name` field in `module_meta.json`.
- **Code formatting tool** – Switched from Black to Ruff formatter. All code is now formatted using `ruff format` with the same 100-character line length. You can run `ruff format .` to auto-format and `ruff format --check .` to verify formatting.
- **Documentation workflow** – Documentation Docker images are now built and pushed automatically when a release is published. Manual documentation builds can be triggered by including "build docs" in a commit message on the develop or main branch, or via the workflow_dispatch workflow in GitHub Actions.
- **Changelog location** – The changelog has been moved to `chacc-docs/docs/changelog.md`. The root `CHANGELOG.md` file has been removed. See the [changelog on chacc.dev](https://chacc.dev/changelog) for the complete history.
- **ChaCC Theme Applied in Swagger UI and ReDoc** - Added custom ChaCC theme styling to Swagger UI and ReDoc interfaces for consistent branding.

### Added

- **Manual Docker workflows** – Added separate workflows for manual Docker builds:
  - `.github/workflows/docker-manual.yml` – Build and push main Docker image on demand
  - `.github/workflows/docker-docs-manual.yml` – Build and push documentation Docker image on demand


### Fixed

- **Module loading duplicate class registration** – Fixed "Multiple classes found for path" SQLAlchemy errors when loading modules by refactoring the discovery and setup phases to use a consistent import mechanism. Both phases now use the same module objects from `sys.modules`, eliminating duplicate SQLAlchemy declarative registry entries.

- **AutoIncrement Indexed ID** – Fixed auto-increment behavior for indexed primary keys from `ChaCCBaseModel`.

> **AutoIncrement Indexed ID** is a breaking change. Ensure to backup your database before upgrading.

## 1.0.0-b4.2

**Update now:**
> PyPi Package:
```bash
pip install chacc-api==1.0.0-b4.post2
```

> Docker
```bash
docker pull jonas1015/chacc-api:1.0.0-b4.2
```

**Beta4.2 fixes a critical startup crash, resolves the audit-schema chicken-and-egg problem, and cleans up model discovery. We have brought you better landing page. If you've had issues with module loading or SQLite table detection, this release is for you.**

---

### Added

- **Smarter model discovery** – Modules now load their dependencies in the correct order automatically, even when imports are nested.
- **Better migration safety** – New dependency resolver and operation executor handle PostgreSQL enum conflicts and ensure migrations run correctly across SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- **Comprehensive test coverage** – Tests now cover migration ordering, safe operation filtering, schema reflection, and model discovery.
- **HTML welcome page** – Adds a dark-mode HTML welcome page with links to Swagger UI, ReDoc, and chacc.dev documentation, replacing the raw JSON root endpoint.


### Fixed

- **Startup crash** – Fixed "Multiple classes found for some modules" crash that occurred when plugin discovery was disabled in development mode.
- **Double model registration** – Removed the old `_model_registry` and now rely exclusively on SQLAlchemy's declarative metadata. No more duplicate table errors.
- **SQLite table detection** – Fixed a bug where `table_exists()` returned incorrect results for existing tables.
- **Audit schema chicken-and-egg** – Split schema initialization into two passes (before and after entry points) so audit fields are applied correctly even when the `enable_audit_fields` service is registered after startup.
- **Module load failure handling** – Failed modules are now properly disabled, preventing repeated crash loops on restart.
- **Logging crashes** – Fixed crashes when logging routes that had `None` paths or methods.

### Changed

- **Module loading sequence** – Both dev and prod modes now follow the same sequence: discover models → initialize database → run migrations → load entry points → apply deferred schema changes → optional follow-up migration.
- **Database initialization** – Now uses `ChaCCBaseModel` subclass enumeration instead of the removed `_model_registry`.

### Removed

- **Redundant startup schema pass** – Removed a duplicate migration run that caused unnecessary migrations in some environments.
- **`_model_registry`** – The old model registry has been removed in favor of SQLAlchemy's declarative metadata.

### Notes

- **Versioning**: The package metadata uses `1.0.0-b4.post2` for PyPI; the user-facing version is `1.0.0-b4.2`. Both refer to the same release.
- **Port default**: All references now consistently use port `8085` (previously some docs mentioned `8080`).
- **`.env` behavior**: The `.env.sample` file is copied from the package to your working directory if missing. This is intentional and unchanged from previous versions.

## 1.0.0-b4.1

**Update now:**
> PyPi Package:
```bash
pip install chacc-api==1.0.0-b4.post1
```

> Docker
```bash
docker pull jonas1015/chacc-api:1.0.0-b4.1
```

### Added

- PostgreSQL enum migration support through `alembic-postgresql-enum`, including handling for `create_enum`, `sync_enum_values`, and `drop_enum` operations.
- Migration runner support for Alembic PostgreSQL enum operation objects generated by `alembic-postgresql-enum`.
- Automatic enum type creation before adding enum-backed columns or tables in PostgreSQL migrations to prevent `UndefinedObject` failures.
- `uuid7`-based default UUID generation for `ChaCCBaseModel`, using Python 3.12+ `uuid.uuid7` with `uuid-utils` fallback on older Python versions.
- `uuid-utils` runtime dependency for environments without native `uuid7` support.
- `SQLITE_DATABASE_NAME` and `SQLITE_DATABASE_PATH` environment variables for custom SQLite database names and storage locations.
- `CHACC_VERBOSE` and `CHACC_DEBUG` environment controls for runtime log level selection.
- CLI `chacc run server -v/--verbose` support that now propagates verbose logging into the server subprocess.
- Docker health checks and exposed ports updated to the current default server port.
- Production Docker Compose now uses the published Docker Hub image directly instead of local image build comments.

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL migration failures when Alembic detects enum changes by importing and enabling `alembic-postgresql-enum` hooks.
- PostgreSQL `UndefinedObject` crashes when adding enum-backed columns or tables by creating enum types before table/column operations.
- Migration operation ordering to apply enum creation before tables, columns, constraints, indexes, and enum synchronization.
- Migration descriptions for enum create, sync, and drop operations.
- CLI verbose flag propagation so `chacc run server -v` affects the child server process.
- Docker and Docker Compose default port mismatch by replacing stale `8080` references with `8085`.
- Alembic log noise by forcing the `alembic` logger to `WARNING`.
- Default logging behavior so normal server runs are quieter while `CHACC_VERBOSE` and `CHACC_DEBUG` still enable detailed logs.
- Repeated logger imports by centralizing default log level detection in `get_default_log_level()`.
- SQLite database path handling so `SQLITE_DATABASE_PATH` and `SQLITE_DATABASE_NAME` configuration takes effect.

### Removed

- Removed redundant `LogLevels.INFO` logger setup across server, database, migration, module loader, Redis, health, and environment validation modules.
- Removed stale Docker `8080` exposed port and health check references.
- Removed local-build instructions from the production Docker Compose file.

### Changed

- README file has been updated to focus on ChaCC brief intro and link the entire guidance to [chacc.dev](https://chacc.dev)

## 1.0.0-b4

**Update now:**
> PyPi Package:
```bash
pip install chacc-api==1.0.0-b4
```

> Docker
```bash
docker pull jonas1015/chacc-api:1.0.0-b4
```

### Added

- **Breaking**: GUID TypeDecorator for cross-database UUID support (PostgreSQL UUID type / SQLite TEXT storage)
- SQLite batch operation support for constraints, indexes, and columns via `batch_alter_table()`
- Automatic `.env` file creation from `.env.sample` on application startup if `.env` does not exist
- `.env.sample` included in package distribution for ready-to-use configuration reference
- Migration version counter suffix to prevent duplicate migration versions
- New database engine detection to distinguish PostgreSQL vs other databases

### Fixed

- **Breaking**: Migration tracker table `rollback_available` column conversion from BOOLEAN to INTEGER for PostgreSQL, and compatibility for SQLITE
- Migration runner now uses `run_in_executor()` for synchronous DB operations to prevent blocking async event loop
- Made tracker/backup lazy properties to defer DB initialization
- Catch ProgrammingError/OperationalError for already-existing resources to make migrations idempotent
- GUID TypeDecorator now returns UUID instances directly without unnecessary conversion
- Tracker table now filtered from migration detection to prevent accidental drops
- Resolved requirements.txt path issue for installed package layout

### Removed

- Removed redundant database type conversion in GUID TypeDecorator

> **Caution:** Users migrating to 1.0.0-b4 will need to drop their existing databases and start afresh. The `rollback_available` column type changed from BOOLEAN to INTEGER, and GUID column changes require a clean schema migration that cannot be automatically applied to existing data.
